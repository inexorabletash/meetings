## Agenda

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è NPU support discussion

The goal of this discussion is to revisit the problem space for NPU support for WebNN, review the high-level proposal for the key elements of the design, gather feedback and signals from the group regarding interest, scope, priority.

NPU device type and support for quantized models have been explored in the group prior and have been awaiting implementation experience.

- ‚®Ä WebNN should support NPU and QDQ operations https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues/623

Related:

- ‚®Ä WebNN should support int8 quantized models https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues/128
- ‚®Ä API simplification: context types, context options, createContext() https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues/302

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Hybrid AI exploration update

A brief update from the project team on the proof-of-concept informed by the group's feedback.

- ‚®Ä Hybrid AI exploration https://github.com/webmachinelearning/proposals/issues/5

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Open issues and PRs

Discuss open issues and review PRs based on your feedback:

- ‚®Ä All [open issues](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues)
- ‚õô All [open pull requests](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/pulls)

A curated shortlist of recently discussed issues below. If any are addressed prior to the meeting, we'll debrief the group on the changes to keep everyone up to date with significant developments. Please refer to the [triage guidance](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/blob/main/docs/IssueTriage.md) for more on our triage practices.

#### üè∑Ô∏è Debrief on PRs merged recently

The editors and PR authors will debrief the group on substantive PRs that got merged in the last few weeks, answer question from the group.

#### üè∑Ô∏è [bug](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/labels/bug)

- Need clarify scale factor for resample2d
  - ‚®Ä https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues/610
  - ‚ò∞ Overflow handling convention preferences?

- Synchronously validate input operands/activations 
  - ‚®Ä https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues/572
  - ‚ò∞ Introduce structure in op creation?

#### üè∑Ô∏è [question](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/labels/question)

- Allow no-op graphs?
  - ‚®Ä https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues/614
  - ‚ò∞ Review issue discussion

- Graph with no input
  - ‚®Ä https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues/615
