## Agenda

### ℹ️ Web LLM project contributions

A discussion with Tianqi Chen on proposed new WebNN use cases informed by the Web LLM project e.g. hybrid execution of models (custom ops w/ WebGPU + WebNN ops), a JSON schema of the WebNN declaration, others.

### ℹ️ Efficient WebGPU integration discussion

During 2023 we've sought for implementation experience and user feedback for the MLCommandEncoder interface that proposes to enable more efficient WebGPU integration. To start the year, we'll revisit the feedback and suggestions to inform this work.
