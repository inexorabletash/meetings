## Agenda

### ℹ️ Delta wide review and a new Candidate Recommendation

Review the proposed plan for delta wide review and refreshed CR Snapshot expected in Q1'24.

Proposal: Build upon the work done in Q1'23 for the initial CR to demonstrate changes since satisfy publication prerequisites:
- Wide review tracker https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues/240
  - Proposal: refresh Arch/TAG and Privacy wide reviews, only inform other horizontal groups
- CR readiness tracker https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues/239
  - Proposal: update implementation experience, test coverage, note significant new & removed features and spec conventions improvements, update use cases

### ℹ️ Issue prioritization

As we're approaching another spec milestone, discuss what are the most urgent and important issues for the group, practical steps we can take to help new contributors e.g. revise our [issue labels](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/labels) and apply them in triage actively.

This practice also helps ensure we meet our wide review objective with gusto, the WG is expected to:
- Document the highest priority open issues or categories
- Ensure the spec remains in a cohesive state including for its informative parts e.g. use cases, programming model sections

### ℹ️ New features

#### MLBuffer

Continue discussion on the proposal for a backend-agnostic storage type for WebNN operations informed by implementation experience.

- [ ] issue: https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues/482
- [ ] Chromium implementation: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5173676

#### AOB

Other open issues discussed subject to time based on your feedback during the issue prioritization exercise.
