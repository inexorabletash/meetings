## Agenda

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Call for Consensus: WebNN API CR Snapshot

On 28 Feb 2024 we issued a Call for Consensus (CfC) to publish the Web Neural Network API as a new Candidate Recommendation Snapshot (CRS).

We'll review CfC results and if satisfied initiate a transition request to get the publication machinery moving.

- [Call for Consensus](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webmachinelearning-wg/2024Feb/0006.html) open until 7 Mar 2024

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Hybrid AI exploration

üí¨ Format: presentation + Q&A

An exploration into hybrid approaches that could flexibly shift ML workloads between server and client to support elasticity and avoid the problem of developers targeting only the weakest clients‚Äô capabilities.

The project team will give a 20-min presentation followed by a Q&A to introduce the problem statement, initial proposed requirements, goals, non-goals, with an eye on the intersect beneficial to the WebNN API.

Expected outcome: Project team receives feedback from this group to help inform the direction of the exploration: past learnings, issue priorities, relevant data points, dos and don'ts all welcome.

Note: Any concrete proposals from this exploration that impact Web APIs are expected to be incubated in applicable Community Group(s) subject to agreement.
