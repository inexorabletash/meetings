## Agenda

### ℹ️ WebNN API delta wide review and CR Snapshot readiness

Status: We're on track. We initiated Architecture/TAG and Privacy delta wide reviews highlighting relevant new information and informed other horizontal groups (a11y, i18n, Security) of the plan to publish a new CR Snapshot during Q1'24. 

We'll discuss any review feedback received.

- Wide review tracker https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues/239

We also review CR Snapshot readiness and discuss any open issues:

- CR readiness & requirements https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues/240
- Proposed high-level status https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/pull/532
