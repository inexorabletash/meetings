### Agenda

#### web-native update

An update on webnn-native open-source project progress and plans (Ningxin):

https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn-native/pull/1

#### Operation-specific APIs

Operation-specific APIs proposal use cases and requirements (Ping, Jonathan):
https://github.com/webmachinelearning/proposals/issues/2

Discuss high-level requirements for WebNN API (Ningxin, Chai):

- Req: Direct access to the convolution op
- Addressed by: https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/pull/149#discussion_r591634607

- Req: Support for native tensor types, GPU buffers
- Addressed by https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/pull/149 for GPU buffers

- Req: Device preference setting when compiling a graph to reduce IO between accelerators
- Addressed by: ?

- Req: Optimization for single-op graph execution
- Addressed by: ?

Proposal to spin these high-level requirements for WebNN API into its own issue to be resolved.
