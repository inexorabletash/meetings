## Agenda

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Understanding and managing the impact of ML models on the Web

The W3C Team has documented its shared understanding of the current and expected systemic impact of AI and ML models in particular on the Web. We'll hear an introduction to this work that references and in part builds upon this group's efforts including WebNN API, Ethical Principles for Web Machine Learning, Hybrid AI exploration, and more.

- ‚ò∞ Understanding and managing the impact of ML models on the Web https://www.w3.org/reports/ai-web-impact/
- ‚®Ä Comments welcome via GitHub issues https://github.com/w3c/ai-web-impact/issues

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è MLBuffer update

Update to the group on the latest developments in the MLBuffer exploration, learnings from the implementation. Spec design discussion to resume informed by the implementation findings.

- ‚®Ä MLBuffer proposal https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues/482
- ‚õô MLBuffer exploration doc https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/pull/541
- ‚õ≠ Chromium implementation https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5173676
